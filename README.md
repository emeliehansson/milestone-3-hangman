# Hangman

For my third milestone project I decided to create a game of Hangman. The theme for this Hangman game is European Countries, so the players task is to guess a letter and eventually find the hidden word. 
For every guess the player gets correct, a new letter will be revealed and eventually the player will hopefully see the word or be able to guess the whole word. 

The game is available to be played on three different levels: Easy (9 lives), Medium (6 lives) or Hard (4 lives).

Good luck & have fun!
